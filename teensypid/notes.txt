/*
 * This is PID feedback control code intended to be used with the Teensy 4.1: 
 
 * Most of the PID feedback control code is from here: https://github.com/mike-matera/FastPID/blob/master/src/FastPID.cpp
 * 
 * look here for code to speed up ADC: https://github.com/pedvide/ADC/blob/master/examples/analogContinuousRead/analogContinuousRead.ino
 * 
 * If using digital control code, use pyserial to adjust setpoint: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pyserial

/*
 * 
 * TODO print warning and sets flag if output has railed (is set equal to max output) when setpoint has not railed
 * 
 */

 /*
  * TODO
  - -add optional buffer that stores output values to be printed at a later date (ro=1, ro=0, ro?)
  * -clean up code, split into multiple files
  * -look through previous todos
  * -(MAYBE) use one digital input to turn feedback control on/off, and use the other as a setpoint
