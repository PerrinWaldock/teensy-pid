TODO
	test analog setpoint? digital setpoint?

python
	create functions for measuring step response
		fit step response to expected
		do off-on, on-on
		need some metrics for performance (stdev?)
	create function for measuring steady-state
		measure allan deviation, generate plot
		come up with some metric?

TODO
	Save log timestamp at 16 bit LSB value, auto-add relevant amount 
		may need to interpolate values
	when printing values to terminal. Possibly remove output from log?
		have a LOG_FEEDBACK, LOG_OUTPUT, LOG_SETPOINT, LOG_TIME #defines, set as needed
	find a way to disable saving output to terminal -- possible have as a setting not preprocessor directive?
		can default to off to speed up response time
	calibrate loop rate from log times?
	calculate rise time metric (deviation from ideal step response curve?)
	reduce time to take single rise time measurement
	make a bunch of functions inline pass by reference to improve speed
	figure out what's slowing down each loop iteration
	GUI
		set pid constants
		calibrate loop rate
		calibrate feedforward
		save constants
		display feedforward function
		display stability
		display rise time
		find best rise time score? (after calibrating feedforward?)
